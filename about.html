                <p>
                    With a strong foundation in data analytics and business communication skills developed through my MIS major,
                    complemented by proficient Java programming knowledge acquired during a semester in computer science,
                    I am well-equipped to tackle complex challenges in today's digital sphere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through my leadership roles in Kappa Alpha Theta, I've further developed communication and leadership skills. 
                    These skills enable me to effectively collaborate with all types of people, each with unique strengths, 
                    to achieve common goals. I proudly served on the executive data committee with OU Dance Marathon, where we raise funds for 
                    Oklahoma Children's Hospital, further deepening my ability to serve with a team striving to make a difference.

                    During an internship at Not Your Average Joe coffee shop, I gained hands-on experience in grant writing, 
                    donation management, marketing, interpersonal communication, and systems improvement. This experience solidified my desire to 
                    utilize my background and expertise to contribute meaningfully to businesses and organizations.
